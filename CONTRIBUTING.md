# Contribution Guidelines

Have a look at issues for some things which need doing. Make a new fork, make some changes, and
submit a pull request. I'll probably accept it, so long as it works :)

Before contributing, **leave a comment** on the relavent issue saying you're working on that issue,
so other people's work won't overlap with yours.
